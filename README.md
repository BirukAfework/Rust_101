# Rust Course Roadmap: Basic to Advanced



## Level 1: Getting Started with Rust
*Goal*: Understand Rust basics, set up the environment, and write simple programs.

- **Introduction to Rust**
  - What is Rust? (History, goals: safety, speed, concurrency)
  - Rust’s key features (zero-cost abstractions, ownership model)
  - Installing Rust (rustup, cargo, rustc)
- **Basic Syntax**
  - Rust variables (`let`, `mut`), see [Variables ](https://github.com/BirukAfework/Rust_101/edit/main/Variables.md).
  - Data types (scalars: integers, floats, booleans, characters; compounds: tuples, arrays) [Data types ](https://github.com/BirukAfework/Rust_101/blob/main/DataTypes.md).
  - Functions (defining, parameters, return values)  see [Functions ](https://github.com/BirukAfework/Rust_101/blob/main/Function.md).
  - Comments and formatting  see [Comments and formatting ](https://github.com/BirukAfework/Rust_101/blob/main/Comments).
- **Control Flow**
  - `if`, `else if`, `else` statements
  - Loops (`loop`, `while`, `for`)
  - Pattern matching with `match`
- **Project**: 
  - Build a simple calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide user inputs)



## Level 2: Core Rust Concepts
*Goal*: Master Rust’s ownership model and essential programming constructs.

- **Ownership and Borrowing**
  - Ownership rules (each value has one owner, ownership transfer)
  - References and borrowing (`&`, `&mut`)
  - Lifetimes (basic introduction)
- **Strings and Memory**
  - `String` vs `&str`
  - Memory management in Rust (stack vs heap)
- **Structs and Enums**
  - Defining and instantiating structs
  - Methods and associated functions (`impl`)
  - Enums and pattern matching
- **Error Handling**
  - `Option` and `Result` types
  - Handling errors with `match` and `?` operator
- **Project**: 
  - Build a to-do list CLI app (add, remove, list tasks)
- **Tools**: 
  - Rust Analyzer (IDE integration)
  - Debugging with `println!` and basic tools



## Level 3: Intermediate Rust
*Goal*: Work with collections, modules, and basic concurrency.

- **Collections**
  - Vectors (`Vec<T>`), Hash Maps (`HashMap<K, V>`), Sets
  - Iterators and closures
- **Modules and Crates**
  - Organizing code with `mod`, `pub`, and `use`
  - Creating and using external crates (Cargo.toml)
- **Traits and Generics**
  - Defining and implementing traits
  - Generic types and functions
  - Trait bounds
- **Basic Concurrency**
  - Threads (`std::thread`)
  - Message passing with channels
  - Shared-state concurrency (Mutex, Arc)
- **Project**: 
  - Build a multi-threaded word counter (count words in multiple files concurrently)
- **Tools**: 
  - Cargo documentation (`cargo doc`)
  - Unit testing with `#[test]`


## Level 4: Advanced Rust
*Goal*: Dive into advanced features, performance optimization, and real-world applications.

- **Advanced Lifetimes**
  - Explicit lifetime annotations
  - Lifetime elision rules
- **Smart Pointers**
  - `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, `RefCell<T>`
  - Interior mutability patterns
- **Advanced Concurrency**
  - `async`/`await` syntax
  - Tokio or async-std for asynchronous programming
  - Atomics and lock-free programming
- **Unsafe Rust**
  - When and why to use `unsafe`
  - Raw pointers, unsafe functions, and FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
- **Performance Optimization**
  - Profiling Rust code (e.g., with `cargo flamegraph`)
  - Memory efficiency techniques
- **Project**: 
  - Build a simple web server with async Rust (using Tokio or Hyper)
- **Tools**: 
  - Clippy for linting
  - Benchmarking with `criterion`


## Level 5: Rust in Practice
*Goal*: Apply Rust to real-world domains and contribute to the ecosystem.

- **Domain-Specific Applications**
  - Systems programming (e.g., file system utilities)
  - WebAssembly (WASM) with Rust
  - Embedded programming with Rust
- **Building Libraries**
  - Designing reusable crates
  - Publishing to crates.io
- **Contributing to Open Source**
  - Finding Rust projects on GitHub
  - Submitting pull requests
- **Project**: 
  - Create and publish a small Rust crate (e.g., a utility library)
- **Tools**: 
  - `cargo publish`
  - Git for version control

## Tips for Success
- Write code daily to reinforce concepts.
- Read Rust error messages carefully—they’re designed to help!
- Experiment with small projects to apply what you’ve learned.
- Engage with the Rust community for support and inspiration.
